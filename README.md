## Introduction

This repository demonstrates the importance and amount of time required to implement and secure a simple standalone system with a LOW categorization. 

The system in this example is a standalone laptop used by an DoD agency for opening compact disks (CDs) received from public agencies and scanning for malicious software. The data processed on this system is UNCLASSIFIED and does not contain personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI); this avoids the requirement of security control overlays and additional regulatory compliance.
