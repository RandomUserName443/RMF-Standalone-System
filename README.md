## Introduction

This system security plan is meant to demonstrate the importance and amount of time required to implement and secure a simple standalone system with a LOW categorization. The system in this example is a standalone laptop used by an Air Force agency for opening compact disks (CDs) received from public agencies and scanning for malicious software. The data processed on this system is UNCLASSIFIED and does not contain personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI); this avoids the requirement of security control overlays and additional regulatory compliance.

## System Security Plan Background

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, specifies minimum security requirements for information systems in seventeen areas. Minimum security requirements in these seventeen areas are met through the use of security controls outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-53. These controls are documented within this system security plan.

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires compliance with minimum security requirements identified in FIPS 200, and the development of a formal system security plan (SSP). Compliance with FIPS 200 is required for information systems within the federal government, and optionally available for use on systems outside of the federal government.

A system security plan (SSP) should be complete prior to accreditation of a system and placing it in production. An SSP is also a living document, which should be updated and routinely reviewed. A plan of action and milestones (POAM) should accompany the SSP. The accrediting official reviews the SSP and POAM, and assesses the risks when authorizing or denying the accreditation of a system.
