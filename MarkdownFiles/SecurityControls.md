# Security Controls 

## Introduction

Below are excerpts from NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, ***Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations***. NIST SP 800-53B, ***Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations***, specifies which controls to select according to the categorization of the system: LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH. The controls below were selected according to the LOW baseline in NIST SP 800-53B, and the contents of each control are excerps from NIST SP 800-53, which specifies the details and implementation of each control.

A true System Security Plan (SSP) would not have a list of controls copied and pasted from NIST SP 800-53, like below. Each control would be tailored to meet organizational needs, risk appetite, and applicability to the system.
