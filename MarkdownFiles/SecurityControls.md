# Security Controls 

## Introduction

Below are excerpts from NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, ***Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations***. NIST SP 800-53B, ***Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations***, specifies which controls to select according to the categorization of the system: LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH. The controls below were selected according to the LOW baseline in NIST SP 800-53B, and the contents of each control are excerps from NIST SP 800-53, which specifies the details and implementation of each control.

A true System Security Plan (SSP) would not have a list of controls copied and pasted from NIST SP 800-53, like below. Each control would be tailored to meet organizational needs, risk appetite, and applicability to the system.


## I. Access Control

### AC-1 Policy and Procedures 

	a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:

		1. [Selection (one or more): organization-level; mission/business process-level; system-level] access control policy that:

			* Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordinating among orgnizational entities, and compliance; and

			* is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and

		2. Procedures to facilitiate the implementation of the access control policy and the associated access controlsl;

	b. Designate an [assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the access control policy and procedures; and

	c. Review and update the current access control:
		1. Policy [assignment: orgnization-defined frequency] and following [assignment: organization-defined events]; and

		2. Procedures [assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [assignment: organization-defined events].

### AC-2 Account Management

	a. Define and document the types of accounts allowed and specifically prohibited for use
	within the system;

	b. Assign account managers;

	c. Require [Assignment: organization-defined prerequisites and criteria] for group and role
	membership;

	d. Specify:

		1. Authorized users of the system;

		2. Group and role membership; and

		3. Access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and [Assignment: organization-defined attributes
		(as required)] for each account;

	e. Require approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] for requests to
	create accounts;

	f. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with [Assignment:
	organization-defined policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria];

	g. Monitor the use of accounts;

	h. Notify account managers and [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within:

		1. [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when accounts are no longer required;

		2. [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when users are terminated or
		transferred; and

		3. [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when system usage or need-to-know
		changes for an individual;

	i. Authorize access to the system based on:

		1. A valid access authorization;

		2. Intended system usage; and

		3. [Assignment: organization-defined attributes (as required)];

	j. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment:
	organization-defined frequency];

	k. Establish and implement a process for changing shared or group account authenticators (if
	deployed) when individuals are removed from the group; and

	l. Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes.
